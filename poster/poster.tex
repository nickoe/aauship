\paragraph{Introduction}
Greenland has in excess of 30.000 kilometers of coastal line with outdated maps. This poses a danger as cruise ships currently navigate these waters carrying as many as 5000 passengers. If such a ship were to hit a rock and capsize, the nearest rescue station along the eastern coast of Greenland can be as many as 1000 kilometers away, and the infrastructure in these areas, can not cope with a sudden increase in population of 
\paragraph{Problem}
Is it possible to estimate the states of a ship using a centralized control strategy and a 9.6kbps radio link?
\paragraph{Path Planner}
Some text about the path planning software goes here, and it will be good. Remember some pictures!

\paragraph{Theory}
The path planner has been based Euler spirals, to define the smalles possible angle with which the ship is able to turn. The Euler spirals are generated planning the track ahead of the ship which generates the most effective turning curve which reduces the amount of fluctuation in the engines. 
\paragraph{Ship model}
The state model of the ship is based on a modified 3-degree of freedom state model by \cite{sorensen} - which is given as: 
\begin{align}
\dot{\begin{bmatrix}
v\\
\theta\\
\omega
\end{bmatrix}} = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{-\beta_x}{m} & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 0 & \frac{-\beta_\omega}{I}
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
v\\
\theta\\
\omega
\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{m} & 0\\
0 & 0\\
0 & \frac{1}{I}
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
F\\
\tau
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
$\beta_x$ and $\beta_\omega$ are the linearized skin frictional drag the ship expriences as it moves through the water. $F$ and $\tau$ are the forward force input and the torque generated by the difference in propeller revolutions. The discrete version of this is computed using the zero-order hold algorithm.

\paragraph{State estimation}
The state model for the Kalman filter is derived as:
\begin{align}
\Phi_{x,y,\omega}(k) = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & t_s & \frac{t_s^2}{2}\\
0 & 1 & t_s\\
0 & \frac{-\beta_{x,y,\omega}}{m} & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
Where $\Phi$ contains 3 identical diagonal entries, each corresponding to a different input signal, thus:
\begin{align}
\Phi = diag\{\Phi_x,\Phi_y,\Phi_\omega\}
\end{align}
As the radio link does not contain any redundancy, a lost packet will be handled by the Kalman filter, by reducing the gain of the filter to zero. If packet verification fails, the filter uses a gain mask $\Lambda$ to zero the gains. This mask is defined as:
\begin{align}
\vec{\Lambda} = diag\{\lambda_x,\lambda_{\dot{x}},\lambda_{\ddot{x}},\lambda_{\lambda{y}},\lambda_{\dot{y}},\lambda_{\ddot{y}},\lambda_{\theta},\lambda_{\omega},\lambda_{\alpha} \}
\end{align}
Where the individual $\lambda$s are given as:
\begin{align}
\lambda = 
\left\{ 
  \begin{array}{l l}
    1 & \quad \text{if measurement is valid}\\
    0 & \quad \text{otherwise}
  \end{array} \right.
\end{align} 
The filter also needs to sort out the different sampling rate aboard the ship. The two main sensors, IMU and GPS, sample at 10 Hz and 1 Hz respectively - which also defines a mask to multiply onto the Kalman filter. This mask puts the gain to zero for the GPS if there is no new sample available. Figure \vref{fig:trends} depicts the absolute error between the true and estimated path for the 3 cases described above.
