AAUSHIP
=======
An Autonomous Unmanned Vessel platform


Git repository
--------------
We now have a common git repository we han push to. You can clone it like this
on unix. If you are not familiar with git, I reccomend that you read through
http://gitref.org/, use it as a reference and try to do all of it just to get
familiar with git.

	git clone /afs/ies.auc.dk/www/www.auv.aau.dk/repo/aauship.git

You now have a folder called aauship in the folder you cloned it in.

As you see the repository is directly on AFS, so you have to be authenticated to
 be able to pull and push.
