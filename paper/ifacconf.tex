This paper considers the subject of running a centralized controller for the purpose of navigating a small Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV). The centralized controller is using a Kalman filter as a state predictor to improve the precision of the navigational aids mounted aboard. The work presents the design of the motion control system as well as the development of a protocol used to push through as much data on a standard 9.6 kbps data link simplex link.

The performance for the algorithms developed in this project, have been tested in Limfjorden in Aalborg, and towards the end, results of these tests are shown.

\section{Introduction}
As up to date mapping of the coastal areas around Greenland is not available, and the process of creating these are a both time consuming and expensive task. One way to reduce both the costs and the amount of time invested in such a project could be to develop small autonomous drones to carry out this task. 

These drones should be controlled by a mothership, which would utilize a simple data link, both to preserve bandwith, but also to make the duration at which the ships are able to sail as long as possible, by limiting the power consumption. 

Currently the main focus of autonomous vehicles have been on aerial, ground and underwater vehicles, why there is close to no research going on about small autonomous surface vessels. An example of such a vessel is the Stingray ASV developed by Isreali Based Elbit Systems. The purpose of this vehicle is somewhat military related, where the purpose of measuring the coastal areas around Greenland are purely humanitarian,

IFAC will not do any final formatting of your paper. Your manuscript should be ëcamera-ready.í Page limits vary from conference to conference. Please observe the conference page limits of the conference for which your paper is intended. {\bf Please do not modify margins. If you are creating a document on your own, please observe the margins as listed in Table 1}.

\section{Methods}

The methods developed in this project - and the papers. 2

\subsection{Path planning algorithm}

{\bf Please use this document as a ìtemplateî to prepare your manuscript. For submission guidelines, follow instructions on paper submission system as well as the Conference website.}

Note that conferences impose strict page limits, so it will be better for you to prepare your initial submission in the camera ready layout so that you will have a good estimate for the paper length. Additionally, the effort required for final submission will be minimal.

Some words might be appropriate describing equation~(\ref{e1}), if 
we had but time and space enough.
\begin{equation} \label{e1}
{{\partial F}\over {\partial t}} =
D{{\partial^2 F}\over {\partial x^2}}.
\end{equation}
See \cite{Abl:56}, \cite{AbTaRu:54}, \cite{Keo:58} and \cite{Pow:85}.

\subsubsection{Control algorithm}
This equation goes far beyond the celebrated theorem ascribed to the great Pythagoras by his followers.
\begin{thm}
The square of the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle equals the sum of the squares 
of the lengths of the other two sides.
\end{thm}
\begin{pf}
The square of the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle equals the sum of the squares 
of the lengths of the other two sides.
\end{pf}


\section{Math}

If you are using Word, use either the Microsoft Equation 
Editor or the MathType add-on for equations in your paper (Insert | Object | Create New | Microsoft Equation or MathType Equation). ìFloat over textî should not be selected. Of course LaTeX manages equations through built-in macros.
