\section{Bow thruster}

The ship design includes a bow thruster, which can be used to perform precision maneuvers in tight spaces. This component is not currently included in our control algorithms, because it has little or no effect on the ship when used at speeds above \colorbox{yellow}{what speeds?}. It will be controlled by the \ac{LLI} with a direction and a \ac{PWM} signal. 
\newline
The electronic design of the bow thruster controller can be found in subsection \ref{subsec:bow thruster controller}: Bow thruster controller.
