To implement the HLI functionality Python was chosen for its ease of writing as well as its extensive library of predefined functions. This enables the programmer to utilize highly complex functions through simple and  On of these libraries is NumPy, which enables the user to define vectors and matrices and do calculations with these, in the same way Matlab does. This made it easy to port Matlab code from simulation to actual implementation. Another library is the MatPlotLib library. This eased the path planning implementation, as it was possible to plot the result of the proposed algorithms during testing. Further, another Python library allowed the script to easily access the OpenStreetMap API and retrieve the relevant data.
The LLI functionality was implemented in C as this is the primary embedded programming language with which the project group has experience.
